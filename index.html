            <p class="first-p">I’m a front-end developer at BoomTown in beautiful Charleston, SC. While I spend most of my work day writing code, I keep tripping over the line between design and development. I generally spend half my time in CSS/LESS/SASS-land and the rest swimming in a sea of JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>I'm passionate about design. I'm outspoken about usability. But most of all, I like working with good people. I contribute to the entire project, from concept to launch. I've designed and built many sites alone from start to finish. But it's only so much fun to be a one-man band. There's nothing better than riffing ideas around a team you love to work with and sharing the honor of a job well&nbsp;done.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Great work is the product of curiosity and research. I'm interested in possibilities. But it's the questions posed by careful boundaries that matter most. There's nothing better than working with a designer who is truly passionate about technology. I just happen to be a developer who is passionate about design. — Need a creative developer?&nbsp; <a href="mailto:seanmccambridgedesign@gmail.com">Get&nbsp;in&nbsp;touch&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

                                Subaru was about to unveil their BRZ concept at the L.A. Auto Show in 2011. It was Subaru's first two-wheel-drive car &mdash; and it was fast! Under a tight deadline, Sean led the development effort and collaborated remotely with a designer in California. Inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://artofflightmovie.com/">The Art of Flight snowboarding website</a>, they designed and built an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webaward.org/winner.asp?eid=19208">award-winning</a> two-dimensional parallax scroller that zooms the user over a stark, racy background image with copy and beautiful shots of the BRZ concept sliding across the page to provide a real sense of smooth, tight-handling speed.<br>

                                Back in my Agency.com/Designory days, the Case IH team wanted to kill two birds with one stone: social engagement and SEO. Their solution was to give Case IH a platform to publish blog posts without the pain of enterprise CMS platforms. While the Case IH website is built within the rigid confines of SharePoint, I created a custom WordPress theme for their Be Ready blog incorporating responsive design. The open-source blogging platform has been serving posts related to the sustainability and future concerns of the agriculture industry since early 2011.<br>

                                While an employee at Designory, I was tasked as the tech lead on the Designory site redesign. Previously, Designory showcased a Flash site and suffered from a lack of visibility in search engines and non-Flash devices. Collaborating with the creative team, I built a boundary-pushing, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webaward.org/winner.asp?eid=19196">award-winning</a> site incorporating both responsive design and an extremely fluid and scalable layout, similar to my current website (which benefits from heavier use of CSS and less reliance on JavaScript).<br>

                                Tubular is a jQuery plugin that injects a YouTube video into a web page as a full-screen, resizable background with just a few lines of code. Job-hunting in Chicago in 2010, I noticed a trend of agencies using full-screen video backgrounds on their sites. Tubular seemed like a straightforward idea that could help designers and novice developers achieve the same effect. Originally hesitant and wondering what kind of plague I might be releasing upon the web-design world, I'm happy to report that the Internets still have not been broken as a result of my plugin.<br>

                                Traditional boats have been a part of my life since middle school when I first visited my brother, then a schooner captain in Maine. The two of us built several boats together. We still share a passion for boats and the sea. Recently, I made a habit of finding interesting boats for sale on the web and emailing links to my brother. Finally, I realized it would make sense to record my findings in a WordPress blog to share with other potential boat lovers. BoatsILike.com is built using responsive design and the &lsquo;Pinterest-style&rsquo; jQuery Masonry plugin.<br>

                <p>Photography &mdash; true to the word's root &mdash; really is writing with light. A wink of a shutter flashes light through a tiny hole onto film or digital <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device">CCD</a> leaving a photograph, a light-stamped imprint of a moment in time. How cool is that? I'm interested in documenting place and experience.<br />
