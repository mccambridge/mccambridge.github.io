## read article about keeping things simple that included going with a one-column layout

## realized i could fade my sidebar to near nothing

you see it's there when you first visit the page b/c you can barely see it. once you identify it's navigational, you tune it out, which is much easier since it's so transparent.

## i circled around the idea

even created an icon and wrote some good CSS and JS to make it work.

at the end of the day, i realized the best thing was to leave it alone and go back to the original, simple, minimal, one-step hover gesture.  you reach for it, feel it, need not click on it and figure it out.  then, you get to go on with your life and read the article, which is presumably why you're here.
