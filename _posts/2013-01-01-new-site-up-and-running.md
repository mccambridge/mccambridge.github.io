Ringing in the new year with a new website!  This is the third version of SeanMcCambridge.com.  Version 2 was up for about a year, but it was more of a placeholder than anything.  As of today, this site is still a work-in-progress, but it's pretty well developed already and, perhaps more importantly, shows a whole lot more personality.

I'll write more about the details of how the site is put together soon &mdash; I'm using a new technique that evolved from playing with fluid layouts and working in a vertical component.  I'm not sure if it's a new thing or not, but I've been thinking of it as proportional design.  It's similar to fluid layout, but everything scales up and down vertically, and I've been able to have a surprising amount of control over the layout simply scaling up and down with the browser width, nearly perfectly.

I'm going to incorporate responsive design soon.  While the site renders pretty well on tablets, it's just too much (and becomes too tiny) on phones.  But the great thing about this technique is it's all CSS.

More soon!
