Side hustles are all the rage. I decided to design some [local inspired t-shirts](https://neighborhoodthreads.com) and learn Shopify at the same time. The brand is called [Neighborhood Threads](https://neighborhoodthreads.com). It's my cool new thing.

It all started with the [Park Circle t-shirt](https://neighborhoodthreads.com/collections/frontpage/products/short-sleeve-unisex-t-shirt). I started with a soccer shield and picked elements from the neighborhood, really sort of inside jokes, and assembled them into a finished shield that I liked.

I heard Josh Homme talk about music once. He said, play for yourself. You're never going to make it making music for an audience. These shirts are for me. I already printed one, and I love it.

I had an issue with one of the suppliers so the inventory isn't where I'd like it to be. I have some more shirts on deck. In the meantime, [check out Neighborhood Threads on Instagram](http://instagram.com/neighborhoodthreads). More soon!
